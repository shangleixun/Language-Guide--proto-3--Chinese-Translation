04 Enumerations

Enumerations

When you're defining a message type, you might want one of its fields to only have one of a pre-defined list of values. For example, let's say you want to add a corpus field for each SearchRequest, where the corpus can be UNIVERSAL, WEB, IMAGES, LOCAL, NEWS, PRODUCTS or VIDEO. You can do this very simply by adding an enum to your message definition with a constant for each possible value.

In the following example we've added an enum called Corpus with all the possible values, and a field of type Corpus:

message SearchRequest {
  string query = 1;
  int32 page_number = 2;
  int32 result_per_page = 3;
  enum Corpus {
    UNIVERSAL = 0;
    WEB = 1;
    IMAGES = 2;
    LOCAL = 3;
    NEWS = 4;
    PRODUCTS = 5;
    VIDEO = 6;
  }
  Corpus corpus = 4;
}

As you can see, the Corpus enum's first constant maps to zero: every enum definition must contain a constant that maps to zero as its first element. This is because:

    There must be a zero value, so that we can use 0 as a numeric default value.
    The zero value needs to be the first element, for compatibility with the proto2 semantics where the first enum value is always the default.

You can define aliases by assigning the same value to different enum constants. To do this you need to set the allow_alias option to true, otherwise the protocol compiler will generate an error message when aliases are found.

message MyMessage1 {
  enum EnumAllowingAlias {
    option allow_alias = true;
    UNKNOWN = 0;
    STARTED = 1;
    RUNNING = 1;
  }
}
message MyMessage2 {
  enum EnumNotAllowingAlias {
    UNKNOWN = 0;
    STARTED = 1;
    // RUNNING = 1;  // Uncommenting this line will cause a compile error inside Google and a warning message outside.
  }
}

Enumerator constants must be in the range of a 32-bit integer. Since enum values use varint encoding on the wire, negative values are inefficient and thus not recommended. You can define enums within a message definition, as in the above example, or outside â€“ these enums can be reused in any message definition in your .proto file. You can also use an enum type declared in one message as the type of a field in a different message, using the syntax _MessageType_._EnumType_.

When you run the protocol buffer compiler on a .proto that uses an enum, the generated code will have a corresponding enum for Java or C++, a special EnumDescriptor class for Python that's used to create a set of symbolic constants with integer values in the runtime-generated class.
**Caution:** the generated code may be subject to language-specific limitations on the number of enumerators (low thousands for one language). Please review the limitations for the languages you plan to use.

During deserialization, unrecognized enum values will be preserved in the message, though how this is represented when the message is deserialized is language-dependent. In languages that support open enum types with values outside the range of specified symbols, such as C++ and Go, the unknown enum value is simply stored as its underlying integer representation. In languages with closed enum types such as Java, a case in the enum is used to represent an unrecognized value, and the underlying integer can be accessed with special accessors. In either case, if the message is serialized the unrecognized value will still be serialized with the message.

For more information about how to work with message enums in your applications, see the generated code guide for your chosen language.
Reserved Values

If you update an enum type by entirely removing an enum entry, or commenting it out, future users can reuse the numeric value when making their own updates to the type. This can cause severe issues if they later load old versions of the same .proto, including data corruption, privacy bugs, and so on. One way to make sure this doesn't happen is to specify that the numeric values (and/or names, which can also cause issues for JSON serialization) of your deleted entries are reserved. The protocol buffer compiler will complain if any future users try to use these identifiers. You can specify that your reserved numeric value range goes up to the maximum possible value using the max keyword.

enum Foo {
  reserved 2, 15, 9 to 11, 40 to max;
  reserved "FOO", "BAR";
}

Note that you can't mix field names and numeric values in the same reserved statement.
